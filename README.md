Welcome. I am an automotive tech by day. I have been learning development over the past 3 to 4 years. In 2024 I have started to learn Ruby and have started playing with Rails 7. I have started to learn about Big O Notation and time and space complexities. I love React and NextJs. I am familiar with Angular. I know Node and Express and am familiar with NestJs. I know SQL and prefer PostgreSql. I know MongoDB. I know the AWS environment and many of it's services. I keep busy coding and learning both design and development by building amd maintaining personal projects. I invite you to review the information below.

I use and enjoy VScode and have used InteliJ. I use Click Up to organize my projects. I utilize WakaTime to gain a better grasp of how much time I spend on projects and what tech I focus on. Here you can see what I have done this week.
